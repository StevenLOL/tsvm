tsvm
====

tsvm is a repository for keeping code related to transductive support vector
machines.  This is to help me present a lecture on transduction for one of my
machine learning classes.  Since I am expected to walk through the algorithm
with a toy data set during my lecture, and since transductive SVMs require
solving a quadratic program, I've decided to use Julia as my language.
